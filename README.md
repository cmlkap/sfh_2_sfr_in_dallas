## About
These map layers show single family homes turned into rentals owned by corporate owners in Dallas County. This map displays all non-mobile home, non-condominium, non-vacant single family properties aggregated by Census block group as the base of eligible properties. Corporate owned rentals are those eligible properties owned by an LLC, LP, bank or other corporate owner.

Some corporate owned properties may be flips, or bought and sold quickly by an LLC, rather than held as part of a rental portfolio. To handle quick flips, a separate layer shows counts of properties with a deed transfer date at least 2 years before the given data year. The base of eligible properties is also those that have not changed owner in two years. 

There are some single family home rentals owned by individuals. These are not identified in this project. 

Data source is Dallas County appraisal district data. Processed in Python.
