## Corporate-owned Single Family Rentals in Dallas County

### You can explore this map [as its own web page here](https://cmlkap.github.io/sfh_2_sfr_in_dallas/)

## About
These map layers show single family homes turned into rentals owned by corporate owners in Dallas County. This map displaus all non-mobile home, non-condominium, non-vacant single family properties as the base of eligible properties. It then looks at those properties for those owned by an LLC, LP, etc. 

To handle quick flips (someone buys but doesn't serve as a landlord and instead resells), a separate layer shows counts of properties with a deed transfer date at least 2 years before the given data year. 

There are some single family home rentals owned by individuals. These are not identified in these particular maps. 

Data source is Dallas County appraisal district data. Processed in Python.
